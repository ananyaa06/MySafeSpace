### Non Profit App 
SafeSpace is an app that is set to transform the way sexual assault survivors access the help they need. Our app is designed to be discreet, so users can seek help without fear of being found out. We have taken great care to ensure that SafeSpace is a safe and secure space where victims can access six critical resources that can help them escape abuse and start the healing process. We are working with [Opportunity Hack](https://ohack.dev/nonprofit/n6EYJTxdbCQEPw8TpKVI) to build a deployable app for Andriod and iOS.
