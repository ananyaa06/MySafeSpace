### Non Profit App 
SafeSpace is an app that is set to transform the way sexual assault survivors access the help they need. Our app is designed to be discreet, so users can seek help without fear of being found out. We have taken great care to ensure that SafeSpace is a safe and secure space where victims can access six critical resources that can help them escape abuse and start the healing process. We are working with [Opportunity Hack](https://ohack.dev/nonprofit/n6EYJTxdbCQEPw8TpKVI) to build a deployable app for Andriod and iOS.

MySpaceSpace uses Slack for communications. To join our channel please click [![Join #safespace to help](https://img.shields.io/badge/Join_safespace_to_help-0183DC.svg)](https://ohack.dev/nonprofit/n6EYJTxdbCQEPw8TpKVI) on our page at [Opportunity Hack](https://ohack.dev/nonprofit/n6EYJTxdbCQEPw8TpKVI). 

If you are interested in contributing to MySafeSpace please join us on Slack, open office hours are Fridays at 4:00PM PST. We also track our work in progress or future ideas in our [issues](https://github.com/ananyaa06/MySafeSpace/issues) and [projects](https://github.com/ananyaa06/MySafeSpace/projects?query=is%3Aopen).

We organize our issues in linked Epics, User Stories, and Tasks for each project we have in progress. Epics give you the high level projects that are then split into User Stories which describe the desired outcome and then come our Tasks which can break down indiviual requirements for that User Story. Depending on the size of the Epic, consider working on a User Story or Task. Or consider looking reporting bugs as they're found. We are excited to have your contribution to our app!
